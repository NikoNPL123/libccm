# libccm
Custom Campaign Manager lib for Starcraft 2 written in c++
# compiling
It compiles for Linux (using gcc or clang), but should also work on Windows and MacOS.
You need libzippp and it's dependencies to compile it. You also need boost filesystem library.
# usage
For now, there is no documentation availble, so you have to check header file.
To begin, just create instance of "CustomCampaignManager".
